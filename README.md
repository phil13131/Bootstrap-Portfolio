# Bootstrap-portfolio

This repo is for the challenge 3 - creating personal portfolio page using Bootstrap CSS Framework. Using already existing code will help to start off and I will style the page further myself in a CSS file. The page will include the key components: navigation bar, hero section, skills/projects section and contact section. The goal of this project is to outline my story, my experience and skills to potential employers. I will be using HTML and CSS for this project.
